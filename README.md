Here a water tracker design with React Native!

I designed a program with React Native that shows how many milliliters of water users drink per day and how many milliliters of water they target that day and enter the data. When users click after submit, the card below is collected. It goes as Drinking, targeting and date, respectively.

In my next work, I will send the data with axios and post, embed it in the API I designed and add it to the database!
